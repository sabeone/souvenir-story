What did you do last night? The last thing you remember is checking into the hotel with your friend, Remy.

Where is Remy? Hmm... You can [[look around the room|Room]] or [[check the bathroom|Bathroom]].

&lt;&lt;set $hasPhone to 0&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $hasWallet to 1&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Room" tags="" position="336,206.5" size="100,100">You drag yourself out of bed and study the room. It is simple, with little clutter. You think that's strange, since you and Remy are not the most organized people.

You notice [[papers on the desk|Papers on Desk]] in the corner.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Bathroom" tags="" position="342,56.5" size="100,100">Despite the light being on, Remy is not in the bathroom.

There is a phone teetering on the edge of the counter. You quickly grab it and turn it on. Remy smiles in the background, so it must be Remy's phone. 

Luckily you remember the PIN to unlock the phone. You notice the battery is low, so you turn it off and put it in your pocket.

Glancing around the bathroom, you notice there is cardboard taped over the wall and something glitters in the sink. You look closer and realize the sink is filled with little glass shards. The mirror must have been shattered at some point. Maybe you should check with Maintenance later.

Now what? You think about [[getting breakfast|Cafe]], but maybe someone at the [[front desk|Front Desk]] knows if Remy left?

&lt;&lt;set $hasPhone to 1&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Papers on Desk" tags="" position="492,208.5" size="100,100">The papers are mostly junk - receipts for food and gift shop items, Remy's sketches of people, probably other hotel guests. Slightly obscured by one drawing, you notice a Polaroid of Remy. You smile and put it in your pocket.

You notice how hungry you are. It feels like you haven't eaten in days! However, you are still worried about Remy. You think about going to the hotel's [[quaint cafe|Cafe]] or going to the [[front desk|Front Desk]] to see if Remy went out.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Cafe" tags="" position="708,206.5" size="100,100">There are many people in the cafe, their quiet conversations punctuated by the sounds of the coffee machines. You get coffee and a bagel and take a seat in one of the few empty chairs.

After finishing, you stand to leave and someone bumps into you. "Excuse me," he says! You nod and make your way [[out of the cafe|Atrium]]. 

&lt;&lt;set $hasWallet to 0&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Front Desk" tags="" position="708,48.5" size="100,100">At the front desk, you ask the receptionist if she knows anything about Remy. "I have not spoken with Remy today," the woman says.

&lt;&lt;if $hasPhone is 0&gt;&gt;You show the woman the Polaroid and ask if she had seen Remy walk by earlier. The woman looks at the Polaroid and then at you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You show the woman your phone, pointing to Remy, and ask if she had seen Remy walk by earlier. The woman looks at the phone and then at you.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; A little smirk curves her lips. "I have not seen Remy," she says.

"Okay...thanks." You feel faint tendrils of dread curl in the pit of your stomach as you start to [[walk away|Atrium]]. That was weird right? Or maybe you should have just eaten breakfast...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Atrium" tags="" position="924,123.5" size="100,100">You stand in the Atrium, trying to figure out what to do next.
&lt;&lt;if $hasPhone is 0&gt;&gt;You think about the receipts in your room. Maybe Remy is in the [[gift shop|Gift Shop]]?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You think about the broken bathroom mirror. Might as well [[get that fixed now|Maintenance Worker]].&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Gift Shop" tags="" position="1083,208.5" size="100,100">The gift shop if full of odd, mesmerizing objects made of beautiful glass, gems, and metals. The entire shop looks out of place in the hotel. You feel drawn to a vase that looks full of fire. On impulse, you take the vase to the [[gift shop checkout|Gift Shop Checkout]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Maintenance Worker" tags="" position="1075,43.5" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if visited("Gift Shop Checkout")&gt;&gt;
Every step you take away from the Gift Shop is a struggle. As you move to the elevator, you see a woman standing in a shadowy corner. Her dark blue coveralls say "MAINTENANCE". The woman's cloudy gaze rolls over you. "You looking for someone?"

"Yes.."

"Ha! So is everyone else. Well come here, sweetie. I'll show you who you're looking for." She gestures towards a long mirror on the wall and you [[step closer|The End Part 2]]...
&lt;&lt;elseif $hasPhone is 1&gt;&gt;
As you walk towards an elevator, you see a woman standing in a shadowy corner. Her dark blue coveralls say "MAINTENANCE". "Hi, my name is &lt;&lt;print $playerName&gt;&gt;. I'm in room 129. Do you know anything about a broken mirror?"

The woman's cloudy gaze rolls over you. "You looking for someone?"

"Yes.."

"Ha! So is everyone else. Well, give me a reason to talk!" You hesitate...and [[reach for your wallet|The End Part 1]].

You reach for your wallet and realize it is not in your pocket! "Excuse me, I can't pay for this right now. Someone stole my wallet!"

The man at the checkout squints at you. "I will remind you once again that traditional forms of payment do not work here. If you are that concerned about your wallet, you can report it to Security," he says disapprovingly.
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;As you pull out your wallet, the man at the checkout clears his throat. "I will remind you once again that traditional forms of payment do not work here," he says disapprovingly.
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
You frown. Why does it sound like you have been here before? "Sorry...What do you mean traditional payments don't work?"

The man sighs. "As I said, these are very special souvenirs. You must give them something to remember you by."

You feel cold all over. A voice in the back of your mind tells you to &lt;&lt;choice [[leave the gift shop|Maintenance Worker][$leftGiftShop = 1]]&gt;&gt;, but your paralyzed body makes you &lt;&lt;choice [[stay near the vase|Buy Vase]]&gt;&gt;.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Buy Vase" tags="" position="1387,207.5" size="100,100">It appears you physically cannot leave the vase behind, so you pay for it.
